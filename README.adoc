= hyper-hacks

Here are my macOS Sierra hacks using some combination of Karabiner-Elements and Hammerspoon.

== Background:

When macOS Sierra hit, everyone using a http://brettterpstra.com/2012/12/08/a-useful-caps-lock-key/[Hyper key hack] based off of Karabiner and Seil felt a deep loss.

This hack with link:https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements[Karabiner-Elements] and link:http://www.hammerspoon.org[Hammerspoon] brings back that old-time hyper key feel, complete with ESCAPE binding.

== Installation:

* Install Hammerspoon
* Install Karabiner-Elements
* Put `hammerspoon/init.lua` in `~/.hammerspoon/init.lua`
* Use Karabiner-Elements to map your desired hyper key to `f18`. Alternatively, you can put `karabiner.d/configuration/karabiner.json` in `~/.karabiner.d/configuration/karabiner.json` which map `delete_forward` to `f18`.

That's pretty much it.
